## The Gates of Morning: Chapter 1

**Dick, standing on a coral outcropping, looked south.** The rough waves of the outer sea crashed against the rocks, sending spray into the air. Before him lay the calm, vast Karolin lagoon – a sea of blue under the watchful gaze of fishing gulls.

This protected pond, encircled by a forty-mile ring of coral, was a world unto itself. It could be a stormy sea or a tranquil lake, depending on the wind. And it was *his* world – the one he’d landed in just yesterday.

Women, children, men – the entire tribe bustled along the beach in the bright sun. They fished with nets, played games, or worked on their woven mats. The canoes resting on the sand were his, and the empty houses where war canoes had once been stored were his too.

Then, his brow furrowed as he looked from the lagoon to the canoe houses. Turning away from the peaceful water, he faced the rough waves of the outer beach and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, barely visible, lay Palm Tree – an island of breathtaking beauty, yet one that harbored danger.

Little Tari, the son of the net maker Le Taioi, sat nearby, watching him. Tari, though young, understood the loss that had befallen his people – all the men had been swept away in war, leaving the women and children defenseless.

Just yesterday, a strange new figure had arrived from the north in a peculiar boat, accompanied by Katafa, the girl who had been lost at sea years ago. The women believed this newcomer was a gift from the gods, sent to be their leader.

Tari, with childlike simplicity, asked, "Taori, who are you?"

Could Dick have answered? Would Tari have understood the strange words of the stranger?

"Tari," Dick began, "I come from a world beyond your own. My name is Dick Lestrange. When I was younger, I was left alone with an old sailor on the island you call Palm Tree. There, I grew up with Kearney, who taught me how to fish and spear. He made toys for me, little ships unlike the canoes on these islands. Then, one day, Katafa, the girl who was blown away in a storm, came to live with us. We lived together until Kearney died, and then we were alone. She taught me the language of Karolin, and we fell in love. We might have lived forever at Palm Tree, but a great ship from the eastern islands came, filled with cruel men who came to cut down the trees. They killed the white men and burned the ship. In our boat, we escaped, taking everything we cherished, including the little ships. We sailed for Karolin, guided by the light of the lagoon."

But Dick couldn’t share all of this. The very name “Dick” had faded from his memory, along with the language he’d spoken as a child. Kearney, the sailor who had raised him, was almost forgotten, lost in the hazy past.

For those who had been shipwrecked and alone for a long time, the past blurred. For Dick, it began with Katafa’s arrival at Palm Tree. Before that, everything was a hazy memory, consumed by the bright tropical light, the storms, the misty rainy seasons. Kearney would have been completely forgotten, except for the little ships he’d made for the boy who was now a man.

He looked down at the questioning child. "I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," the child replied. "I ask as I breathe, but not big people – madyana – will ever answer a child's questions. Ai, the fish!" His mind had already moved on, drawn by the cries of other children hauling in nets. He ran off.

Dick turned his gaze north again. Tari’s question had stirred his thoughts, and he remembered the schooner that had briefly visited Palm Tree before being burned by the Melanesians. He recalled Katafa and himself escaping in the dinghy Kearney had taught him to handle. He remembered landing on this beach yesterday, surrounded by the tribe who now considered him their chief and leader.

Then, as he looked north, the memory of the men who had taken Palm Tree stained the beauty of the sea and sky.

There was no immediate fear of the men who had taken over Palm Tree. The islanders didn't have canoes, but they would build them – surely they would. And as surely as he had seen the Karolin lagoon light in the sky, they would see it too and come. It might be a long time, but they would come.

Dick felt like a ghost, a kanaka, a savage, yet the white man was still there. He could think ahead, plan, and imagine.

That was why he had sent a canoe this morning to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata – three old men, too old for war, but skilled canoe builders. That’s why his eyes had brightened when he saw nearly a hundred young men ripening for war, but beneath it all, fueling his mind and lifting his spirit, was his deep affection for Katafa – his other self, more precious than life itself – and the vague, unsettling threat she faced.

War canoes! Would he fight any invaders in the lagoon or as they approached? Or would he be the one to attack, destroying the source of the danger before it could grow? Who knew?

A hand touched his shoulder, and he turned to see Katafa. A strand of dark hair escaped her braided vine and floated in the breeze like an eagle’s feather. Her eyes, dark and luminous, weren’t fixed on him, but on the line of the northern sea.

“Look!” she said.

At certain times and in specific weather conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, could be seen from Karolin through a mirage. Last night they had seen it, and now it was beginning to reappear – a mysterious shimmer low in the southern sky, a dull spot in the sea that grew and hardened until, as if painted by an unseen hand, the island appeared beautiful as a dream – diaphanous yet vivid.

With her hand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, their minds untutored, unaware of the concept of mirages, their eyes fixed on the place from which they had fled and which was now rising so strangely beyond the far sea line, as if to greet them.

They saw again the horde of savages on the beach, figures monstrous as nightmares. They felt the wind filling the sail as the dinghy raced for safety. They heard the shouts of the Melanesians, driven mad by rum stolen from the schooner they had brought ashore and burned. And there, before them, lay the scene of the tragedy – a beautiful picture that masked the horrors still within.

Then, as Dick gazed at this loveliness, which was both a threat and a warning, his nostrils flared, and his eyes darkened with a fierce hatred. They had threatened him – that was nothing. They had threatened Katafa – that was everything – and they still threatened her.

Some day they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to repeat what instinct told him. They would build canoes, and seeing the lagoon mirror-light in the sky, they would come. They had no women, those men, and here were women. Instinct whispered that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon for an island whose tribe might be raided for women, seeing the lagoon light, they would come.

Ah, if he had known, danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred might roam on that azure sea, not only amongst savages, but the wolves of civilization.

For Dick, there was no world beyond the world of water that surrounded the two islands. No Europe, no America, no history but the history of his short life with Katafa, and even in that short time, he had learned to dread men and had envisioned the foundation of all history – man’s instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.

Then gradually, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade, vanishing like a light blown out. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed across the water to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.

It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they came down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.
